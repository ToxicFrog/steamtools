LuaXML-0.0.0
============

This is an initial release of LuaXML - a native XML parser for Lua.

The code (and documentation) is not complete as yet however it is usable 
and this release is indended to avoid potential duplication between efforts 
and get early feedback. 

The API is relatively stable however there may be some detailed changes.

The distribution comprises -

    README          - This file
    xml.lua         - Main XML parser module
    handler.lua     - Standard XML handlers
    testxml.lua     - Command line test tool
    xmlrpclib.lua   - XMLRPC marshaller/unmarshaller
                      (incomplete and now probably superseeded)
    xmlrpc-lua.cgi  - Test XML-RPC server (CGI)
    cgi.lua         - CGI module to support XMLRPC server
                      (will probably be packaged separately idc)
    cgitest.cgi     - 
    pretty.lua      - Lua pretty printer [23/02/2001 jcw@equi4.com]

Most of the modules are relatively well documented in the source - the key
ones are 'xml.lua' & 'handler.lua'. The 'testxml.lua' utility is also
useful for testing the modules.

This is all being released a bit earlier than I would have liked due
to all the current XML related activity on lua-l and as a result isnt
quite as well packaged/docuemnted as I would like. I will be working
on fixing this asp.
