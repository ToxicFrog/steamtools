The biggest point of interest here is probably categories.lua. You'll need lua
5.1, luasocket, and luafilesystem to run it. Windows users can just install
LuaForWindows and get everything they need.

To install it, put this directory -inside- your steam directory; ie, things
should look like this:

Steam/
  Steam.exe
  ClientRegistry.blob
  Steam.log
  steamtools/
    README
    categories.lua

!!! EXIT STEAM BEFORE YOU RUN THIS !!!

To run it, just run categories.lua. It'll autodetect the last user to log in to
steam and create a new directory for them containing a file for each game they
own, and a directory for each category. You can now move the files around,
create, delete or categories, and the like; when you re-run the program it will
update your Steam category information. Every time you run it, it'll update
Steam's categories based on where you put the files, then add files for any new
games you've acquired since last time you ran it.

If you want to re-create this directory from Steam's saved categories, just
delete it and run the program again.

If something goes horribly wrong and it completely destroys your Steam
configuration or something, it's created a backup; delete this file:
  Steam/userdata/<your user id>/7/remote/sharedconfig.vdf
And replace it with this one:
  Steam/userdata/<your user id>/7/remote/sharedconfig.vdf.backup
This is the only Steam file it changes.


There are also three smaller tools included:

backloggery.lua will upload a game list to Backloggery.com. Documentation is in
the comments.

steamids.lua and steamgames.lua will read a game list from your Steam community
page (run as 'lua steamids.lua <community profile name>') and output it as
"ID\tName" for the former and "PC\tREADY\tName" for the latter - the latter
format is meant to be used with backloggery.lua.

steamlib.lua and steamlib/vdf.lua are only of interest to programmers; they
comprise a library for getting Steam-related information and saving and loading
steam VDF files.
